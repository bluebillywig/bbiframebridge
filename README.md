# bbiframebridge ðŸŒ‰

This GitHub-hosted NPM package provides an iframe bridge, enabling you to communicate with Blue Billywig iframes (players) in your web app. 
Hereâ€™s how.

## Adding to your package.json ðŸ“¦
```
        "dependencies": {
                "bbiframebridge": "https://github.com/bluebillywig/bbiframebridge"
        }
```

## Importing and bootstrapping ðŸ¥¾
```
import BBIframeBridge from 'bbiframebridge';
BBIframeBridge.bootstrap();
```

## Usage
After bootstrapping the bridge already works for going fullscreen and for local storage.  

If you look up the bridge instance for an iframe you want to control (e.g. window.bluebillywig.BBIframeBridges[0] ), you can issue callChild commands (e.g. 'play', 'pause'), or callChildPromise commands when the return value matters (e.g. 'getDuration', 'getPlayoutData'). See [the player API](https://support.bluebillywig.com/player-api/methods/).
```
const br = bluebillywig.BBIframeBridges[0];
const playoutData = await br.callChildPromise('getPlayoutData');
```

## Troubleshooting
If installing the bbiframebridge dependency fails -- ```npm install``` tries to build the package from source in your build environment -- you can always resort to including the pre-built stand-alone version:  
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.bluebillywig.com/scripts/bbiframebridge/latest/bbiframebridge-standalone.js"></script>
